# Project Titile: Perceptron Clustering on Wikipedia Data

We have a well-written project report in this repository. Please read the pdf file `hadoop-final-project.pdf`. 

The rest of the files are all scipts that are used in building our hybrid multi-parallel system to complete the project. Each of the file is explained in the pdf file `hadoop-final-project.pdf`.

The parallel technique of *Hadoop*, *MPI(Message Passing Interface)*, and *Pthreads* are greatly used in this project when we dealt with massive data downloading, wrangling, and anaylyzing.
